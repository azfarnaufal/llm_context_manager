    "Okay, here's a concise summary of the conversation:\n\n**User Goal:** The user wants to create a new AI in Python with a Delphix-like memory pattern and compression system, semantic search, and a training system that learns from AI/LLM interactions instead of text datasets.\n\n**Conversation Summary:**\n1. **Project Setup:** The assistant created a project directory (`ai-project`) and an initial `README.md` file.\n2. **Memory Management:** A basic memory manager (`memory_manager.py`) was implemented using `pickle` for serialization and `gzip` for compression, with in-memory caching.\n3. **Semantic Search:** A simplified semantic search component (`semantic_search.py`) was created using cosine similarity on word embeddings (represented as vectors).\n4. **Training System:** A training system (`training_system.py`) was developed using a self-supervised approach with a masked language modeling technique. This system now uses Tensorflow with a simple LSTM model.\n5. **Documentation:** Throughout the process, the assistant updated the `README.md` with project details and progress. The assistant also asked follow-up questions about the current status and future direction.\n6. **Completion:** Finally, the assistant completed the implementation of the training system and attempted completion.\n\n**Key Features:**\n*   The project avoids direct web searches or external library installations.\n*   The assistant used provided tools to create and modify files.\n*   The assistant provided documentation and updated it accordingly.\n* The assistant utilized a simplified method for each required component with the constraints available.\n\n**State:** The project directory now contains four files: `README.md`, `memory_manager.py`, `semantic_search.py`, and `training_system.py`.\n"
